# Predicting Human Brain Activity using Brain Imaging Data

This is the code for the project 'Predicting Human Brain Activity using Brain Imaging Data' by Tushar Bansal and Keshav Goyal. The project is inspired by [Prof. Tom Mitchell's](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) work on fMRI patterns.

The dataset used for the analysis can be found at: [link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-73/www/science2008/data.html)

[LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) Library(by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin) was used in this code.
